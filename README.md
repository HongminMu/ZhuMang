# **Wearable Visuomotor Navigation and Mobility Assistance Device for the Partially Sighted and Visually Impaired in Unfamiliar Indoor Scenes** 👓 

## **🌟 Project Overview**  
This project, formally titled **"Wearable Visuomotor Navigation and Mobility Assistance Device for the Partially Sighted and Visually Impaired in Unfamiliar Indoor Scenes"**, enhances **mobility and independence** for visually impaired individuals by enabling **navigation in unfamiliar indoor environments without relying on dense pre-built maps**.

🚀 **Key Features:**  
✅ **SLAM-free navigation** – Uses **Topological Semantic Mapping (TSM)** instead of conventional dense mapping.  
✅ **Text-based Localization** – Matches detected text from environmental signage with TSM nodes for precise positioning.  
✅ **Binocular Stereo Vision** – Enhances depth estimation to assist in navigation toward key landmarks.  
✅ **AI-Driven Obstacle Detection** – Uses deep learning for real-time scene awareness.  
✅ **Multi-Device Wearable Interaction** – Smart glasses process visual data, while wristbands provide haptic feedback.
